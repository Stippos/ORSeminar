My conjecture is that average credit cards per active account < average credit cards per account. This is also a pretty important number that affect most of the calculations so maybe more consideration could be put into this\n",

    "- You can only have one late payment fee per month. This is probably not the case but in this simple model it is assumed you get only one late payment fee for not paying you bills each month. However late payment fees are a pretty small cash flow so the impact of this assumption is not as huge as for example collection percentage's.\n",
